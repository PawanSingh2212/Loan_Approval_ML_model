# Loan_Approval_ML_model
A machine learning project for predicting loan approval based on applicant details. Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building using Pytho

- Loan approval prediction refers to the use of machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a loan application being approved or denied by banks and financial institutions. By using advanced algorithms and predictive models, banks can streamline their loan approval processes and make informed decisions for the benefit of both lenders and borrowers.

#### Task is to create a predictive model that accurately determines whether a loan application should be approved or denied based on the given loan approval prediction dataset. The dataset includes various details about loan seekers including their personal and financial information, such as gender, marital status, education level, income, loan amount, loan term, credit history, property size and loan approval status.

# The dataset contains 

1- Loan_ID: Unique identifier for each loan application 
2- Gender: Gender of the applicant 
3- Married: Marital status of the applicant 
4- Dependents: Number of dependents.
5- Education: Education level of the applicant 
6- Self_Employed: Whether the applicant is self-employed 
7- ApplicantIncome: Income of the applicant 
8- CoapplicantIncome: Income of the co-applicant 
9- LoanAmount: Loan amount requested 
10- Loan_Amount_Term: Term of the loan in months 
11- Credit_History: Credit history score 
12- Property_Area: The area of property 
13- Loan_Status: Whether the loan was approved
